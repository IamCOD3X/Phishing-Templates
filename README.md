## üìú Description
WiFiPumpkin3 is a powerful framework for auditing and testing network security. The CaptiveFlask module allows the creation of custom captive portal templates that simulate network login pages. These templates can be used for:

- **Network security testing**: Assessing the security of your own or authorized networks.
- **Awareness training**: Demonstrating how attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in public Wi-Fi networks.
- **Defense planning**: Understanding attack techniques to better defend against them.

## üîß Features
- **Customizable Templates**: Modify templates to suit different testing scenarios.
- **Realistic Patch**: Enhances templates to make captive portals more convincing and secure for testing.
- **Educational Use Only**: A resource designed with security professionals and students in mind.

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. **Installation**: Follow the official [WiFiPumpkin3 documentation](https://github.com/P0cL4bs/WiFi-Pumpkin) to set up the framework.
2. **Template Setup**: Copy the CaptiveFlask templates from this repository into your WiFiPumpkin3 directory.
3. **Customization**: Edit templates as needed to create realistic testing scenarios.
4. **Testing**: Only use these templates in environments where you have full permission to test.

## üõ°Ô∏è Legal and Ethical Use
- Ensure that your testing activities comply with all local and international laws.
- Obtain proper authorization from network owners before conducting any security assessments.
- Misuse of this tool can lead to severe legal consequences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
